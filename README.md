# NPM Search Omni
NPM module search for Google Chrome. Results are Googles and not NPM.

### Install
Download this repo and place anywhere on your computer. In Chrome go to your extensions [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/), click `Load unpacked extension...`, go to the downloaded extension directory, and click select.

### How To Use
In the Chrome omnibox(where you type urls) you are now able to type `npm` and then a module name. The results you will see are Googles search results of npm modules. This seems to be better results than the actual npm search.

I hope this helps people find better npm modules.
